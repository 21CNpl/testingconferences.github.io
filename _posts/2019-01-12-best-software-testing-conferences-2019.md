Attending conferences is one of the best ways to keep-up on the latest testing + quality knowledge and to connect with your peers in the larger testing communities. As is usual focus is a goal of this project and as a result, only conferences, un-conferences and workshops that are specifically for software testing and quality are listed. Having said that, we definitely think people should visit other tech conferences as it allows us to become better informed and more well rounded.
