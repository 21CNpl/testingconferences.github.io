Attending conferences is one of the best ways to keep-up on testing/quality/automation skills and knowledge and to connect with your peers in the larger testing communities. Here is our shortlist of the most popular testing conferences and workshops in 2019.

As is usual focus is a goal of this project and as a result, only conferences, un-conferences and workshops that are specifically for software testing are listed. Having said that, we definitely think people should visit other tech conferences. That allows us to become better informed and more well rounded.
