As many of us know the World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Work, school, travel, and public life are changing every day. Uncertainty has created stress and concern about travel plans. 

Conferences all over the world are being canceled or postponed as companies and governments put in place travel bans and people look to avoid large groups. Most of the tech conferences which have been canceled are large scale events, however even the testing community has seen a few conferences canceled. 

## Software testing conferences canceled this year:

- [STPCon Spring 2020](https://www.stpcon.com/pricing-spring-2020/?utm_source=testingconferences)
- [TestBash Detroit 2020](https://ti.to/mot/testbash-detroit-2020?source=testingconferences)


Luckily there have only been few. I'll try to keep this list updated as changes happpen.
