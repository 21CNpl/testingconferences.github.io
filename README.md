# Testing Conferences
This is a simple list of software testing conferences and workshops published collaboratively with the testing community.

# Contributing Guidelines
The list of events is driven by files in the ```_data``` folder - if you have an update for those things, just change the ```current.yml``` and ```past.yml``` files and send a PR. The _order_ of the events listed in ```current.yml``` and ```past.yml``` dictates the _order_ displayed, please make sure to properly insert events.

  - If possible, spell out the conference name and add the abbreviation. Otherwise just use the abbreviation
  - Include the year
  - Don't include the @ symbol for the twitter handle

_Eligible Conferences and Workshops_

Focus is a goal of this project and as a result, only conferences and workshops that are specifically for software testing are listed. That means that if a conference covers software testing, but is not specifically for testers, then it is left out.

A good rule of thumb for whether a conference should be included is if its name includes either Testing or Test and how it describes itself.

_A separate repo_

At the moment the repository is under my Github account (as you can see). In the near future I'd like to broaden things a bit by transferring it into a separate organization where many people could help guide itâ€™s path.
