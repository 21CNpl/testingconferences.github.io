TestingConferences.org is a simple list of conferences and workshops in (software) published collaboratively with the testing community.

_Eligible Conferences_

Focus is a goal of this project and as a result, only conferences and workshops that are specifically for software testing are listed. That means that if a conference covers software testing, but is not specifically for testers, then it is left out.

A good rule of thumb for whether a conference should be included is if its name includes either Testing or Test and how it describes itself.
