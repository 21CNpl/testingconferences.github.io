**About**

TestingConferences.org is a simple list of conferences and workshops in (software) testing published collaboratively with the testing community.

**Eligible Conferences**

Focus is a goal of this project and as a result, only conferences and workshops that are specifically for software testing are listed. That means that if a conference covers software testing, but is not specifically for testers, then it is left out.

A good _heuristic_ for whether a conference should be included is if its name includes Test(ing) and/or how it describes itself.
